    <h3>Instructions: Make a map of the area where you grew up (if you are comfortable sharing this information --  otherwise make a map of a different area of your interest). You will have to find (online) a vector data set for your county, state or country, and use this to make the map.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Do an online search for GIS data in the neighborhood, county, state or country that you choose. Look first for the neighborhood, and if you don't find data at that scale, then search at the county/city level, and if you don't find data at that scale, then search at the state and finally at the country or world level (eg: UN or FAO database).</li>
        <li>Create a map displaying the base map (as described in lecture, and one that is not OpenStreetMap) and at least 2 additional layers. Change the symbols to make the map clearer and to practice using symbology.  The map should include a title, a legend, a north, and a scale.</li>
        <li>Answer the following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>What was the finest scale of data that you found  (e.g., neighborhood, city, county, state, country or global scale) ?</li>
            <li>List at least 5 layers of data that you found and up to ten types of layers that you found.</li>
            <li>In what formats could the data be downloaded?</li>
            <li>What changes did you make to the symbology to make the map easier to understand?</li>
            <li>What problems, if any, did you encounter while trying to use a particular dataset?</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

<h3>Where can I find data?</h3>
<p>A good starting point is going to your favorite browser and search engine and entering the name of your neighborhood, county or state, and add the keywords "shapefile" or "geojson" or "GIS layers" or "GIS data."</p>
<p>You can also go to your city or county's official webpage and look for GIS data or mapping data.</p>

<h3>What will you turn in before the deadline?</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Upload your map as a PNG to Sakai. The map should have your name,&nbsp;title, scale, legend and a north.</li>
	<li>Upload a text file answering the questions above.</li>
	<li>In the same text file, make a list with the names for&nbsp;<u>each of the layers</u>&nbsp;that you used, and the html link to the location where you obtained the data</li>
