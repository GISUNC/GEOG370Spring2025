    <h3>Instructions: Make a choropleth based on ratios and using 3 different classification schemes</h3>
    <p>Using the same data as the previous homework, create a ratio and upload 3 maps using 3 different modes of
        categorizing the data in QGIS. If your original data was a ratio, do the map with a another dataset that is a count data, and do the proper ratio. 
        For each map add a title that describes the ratio and the mode used to categorize
        the data. On a document or the Canvas text box explain the ratio that you did and the reason for creating that ratio. Also discuss breifly the
        pros and cons for each classification scheme. </p>
    <p>Upload the maps and the explanation to Canvas</a>
