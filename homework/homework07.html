    <h3>Instructions: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map from vector data and a csv that you cleaned and
        joined. </h3>
    <p>Make a map about a topic of your interest. The map must not be of a Census topic, use Census data or use a vector file that already has a joined table. The map can be a choropleth, a proportional symbol map, or both. Upload your map, the vector files and the cleaned csv to Canvas. Inlcude a link to the source to the CSV (agency/website). The map can be from any place in the world and at any scale, as long as is a choropleth or a proportional symbol map that you originally created by joining data. I will accept proportional symbol maps based on CSV with geometry, as long as the CSV has been cleaned and it shows that you have put some effort into selecting an interesting symbol. Proportional symbol maps need to include other vectors (polygons or lines) with labels to put the map into context. The maps need to include a legend and a north and scale if necessary. Include a description of your map and your reasons to select that topic.
    </p>
    <p>You will upload to Canvas the map, the cleaned csv, the link to the data source(s), the vector file, and a description of your map.</p>
