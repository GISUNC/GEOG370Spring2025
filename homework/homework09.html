<div style="display:inline-flex; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    <h2>Deadline: </h2>
    <h2 class="date">hw9</h2>
    </div>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>On GEE, upload a point, line or polygon layer related to a topic of your interest (you can use data from your HW8). Also upload a polygon of a city or county boundary that contains the vector layer you added. Create a distance raster from the vector of interest and clip the distance raster to the city or county boundary.   Make a map centered on the area that you are presenting. The map should present the clipped distance layer and the uploaded vector. The distance raster should have a well-chosen color palette, and each layer should be properly labeled (e.g.: the layers in the layer control should not be named “Layer 1”).       
</p>
<p> Submit (1) a screenshot that shows your output and the code and (2) copy and paste your code into the Canvas text box. </p>
